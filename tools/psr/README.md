# PSR Testing Tool

The PSR testing tool is used to test Verrazzano performance, scalability, and
reliability. The tool works by doing some
work on the Verrazzano cluster, then collecting and analyzing results. The type
of work that is done depends on the goal of the test,
and it can be done at any layer. For example, you could test OpenSearch REST API
while doing a Verrazzano upgrade, or even
a Kubernetes upgrade.

## Concepts

### Backend

The tool consists of backend pods that are deployed using Helm charts. The
backend consists of a single image
that has all the worker code. When a pod is started, the worker config, is
passed in as a set of Env vars.
The main.go code in the pod gets the worker type, creates an instance of the
worker, then invokes it
to run. The pod only runs a single worker, which executes until the pod
terminates, by default.

### Use Cases

The term `use case` just describes what the worker does. Each backend pod runs
exactly one `use case` at a time,
in the context of a worker. Each use case is a focused task, like log
generation, making HTTP GET requests against
some endpoint, or repeatedly scaling a component.

To run a use case, just do a Helm install or upgrade. Each use case has a set of
Env vars stored in override files
that define the configuration. For example, to deploy a use case to
generate logs using 10 replicas, you would run the following command:

```
helm install psr-log-gen manifests/charts/k8s -f manifests/usecases/loggen.yaml --set replicas=10
```

**NOTE** The worker code for a use case expects all dependencies to exist at the
time of execution. This is the job of the scenario,
described next. Workers should not know about other workers, or explicitly
depend on them (in the worker code itself). With that said,
a worker could be written to gracefully wait until some required dependency was
ready before doing the work, but it would never create or
provision a dependency.

### Scenarios

Scenarios are a combination of one or more use cases running concurrently.
Consider the scenario where one use case generates logs and another that scales
OpenSearch out and in, repeatedly.

To run a scenario, you install two Helm releases as follows (note some use cases
might not exist yet):

```
helm install psr-log-gen manifests/charts/k8s -f manifests/usecases/opensearch/loggen.yaml --set replicas=5
helm install psr-scale-out manifests/charts/k8s -f manifests/usecases/opensearch/scale-out-in.yaml --set replicas=1
```

The override file for the scale use case might look like this:

```
envVars:
  PSR_WORKER_TYPE: WT_OPENSEARCH_SCALE_OUT_IN
  PSR_OS_TIER: master
  PSR_MAX_PODS: 5
  PSR_MIN_PODS: 3  
  PSR_INTERATION_DELAY: 5s
  PSR_DURATION : 1h
```

The OpenSearch worker code would read those Env vars at run time and behave
accordingly.

### Metrics

The workers themselves will generator metrics so that we know what kind of load
they are putting on the system,
and to also have insight to their progress to be sure that they working as
expected.

### Remote Execution

There is nothing preventing a worker accessing a cluster different than the one
it is running in. You
would just need to put the KUBECONFIG in a secret and pass the secret info to as
an Env var. However,
the default mode and intention is that these workers run in the Verrazzano
cluster that is being measure.

### The Backend Image

The backend image is a private image that should never be made public in
ghcr.io. The image is
built using scratch.

## Source Code

The `backend` directory has the go code which consists of a few packages:

* config - configuration code
* metrics - metrics server for metrics generated by the workers
* spi - the worker interface
* workers - the various workers

The `manifests/charts` directory has the Helm charts. There is a single chart for using
either OAM or plain Kubernetes resources to deploy the backend.  The default is OAM, use
deploy without OAM, use `--set appType=k8s`

The `manifests/usecases` directory has the Helm override files for every use
case. These files must contain the configuration, as key:value pairs, required by the worker.

## Usage

Use the Makefile to build the backend image or execute other targets. If you
just want to try the example use case on a local Kind cluster, then run the following which
builds the code, builds the docker image, loads the docker image into the Kind cluster, and deploys the example use case.
```
make run-example-k8s
```

After you run the make command, run `helm list` to see the `psr` release. The
get the logs for backend pods in the default namespace to see that they are just logging then sleeping in a loop.

**NOTE:** Any Kubernetes platform can be used (OKE, OCI), Kind is just one
example.

The other Make targets include:  
* go-build - build the code
* docker-build - calls go-build, then build the image
* docker-push - calls docker-build, then push the image to ghcr.io.
* kind-load-image - calls docker-build, then load the image to a local Kind cluster
* run-example-oam - calls kind-load-image, then deploy the example worker as an OAM app
* run-example-k8s - calls kind-load-image, then deploy the example worker as a Kubernetes deployment

### Example Helm Installs

Install the example worker as an OAM application with 10 replicas:
```
helm install psr-example manifests/charts/worker --set imageName=ghcr.io/verrazzano/psr-backend:local-582bfcfcf --replicas=10
```

Install the example worker as an OAM application using the default image in the helm chart, providing an imagePullSecret
```
helm install psr-example manifests/charts/worker --set imagePullSecrets[0].name=verrazzano-container-registry
```

Install the logging generator worker as a Kubernetes deployment using the default image in the helm chart.  Note the appType must be supplied:
```
helm install psr-loggen manifests/charts/worker --set appType=k8s -f manifests/usecases/opensearch/loggen.yaml
```

## Workers
All of the worker are deployed using the same worker Helm chart.  Every worker, except the example, have the following requirements: 
* must emit metrics
* must not log while doing work, unless that is the purpose of the worker

### Example
#### Description
The example worker periodically logs messages, it doesn't provide metrics.
   
#### Configuration
no configuration overrides
   
#### Run
```
helm install psr-example manifests/charts/worker 
```

### LogGen
#### Description
The loggen worker periodically logs messages.  The goal is to put a load on OpenSearch since fluentd collects the container logs and
sends them to OpenSearch.

#### Configuration
no configuration overrides

#### Run
```
helm install psr-loggen manifests/charts/worker -f manifests/usecases/opensearch/loggen.yaml
```

### GetLogs
#### Description
The GetLogs worker periodically get messages from OpenSearch, in-cluster.  This worker must run in the mesh.

#### Configuration
no configuration overrides

#### Run
```
helm install psr-getlogs manifests/charts/worker -f manifests/usecases/opensearch/getlogs.yaml
```
