# We create a temporary directory to dump info. The basic structure is along these lines.

#		deployments.json
#		events.json
#		pods.json
#		replicasets.json
#		replication-controllers.json
#		services.json
#		directory per pod

# REVIEW: We certainly could capture some of the above per-namespace into the hierarchy
#         created by the cluster-info.
# NOTE: We are capturing details into json (a few version dumps aren't), this ultimately will be consumed by the triage
#       tooling but it is also human readable.
# EVOLVING: This is a first cut that captures everything (quick/easy), we may not want that to remain as an option
#      but by default we will really want to capture details about our namespaces, and capture some info otherwise.
#      So we will want to have some options to control what we capture here overall. Maybe:
#         base: This would be default and would capture Verrazzano related namespaces
#         full: This would
# REVIEW: As this is intended to be used to assist in issue handling, we do not want to capture things from a customer
#      environment which may be considered sensitive. The intention is that both the capture and triage tooling ultimately
#      would be runnable by the customer entirely (ie: we would never receive the captured data), but we need to be
#      careful in any case as once captured into an archive they need to be aware in how they handle it, and we may
#      need to trim down more from what we capture as well.
