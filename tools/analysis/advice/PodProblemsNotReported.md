# Summary
Analysis detected that there were pods which were not in a running, succeeded, or pending state.

The Analysis was not able to determine a specific root cause, however it may have supplied data that is related to the pods in question.
The root cause might be obvious from the supporting data here, and the analysis tool simply isn't isolating the specific scenario yet.

# Steps
1. Review the analysis data supplied. At a minimum, this should indicate which Pods were being impacted, and it may give other clues on the root cause.
