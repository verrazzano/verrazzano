// NOTE: This is part of the contract with the analyzers however it is currently an initial stake in the ground and
//		 will be evolving rapidly initially as we add analysis cases

// TODO: We have rudimentary settings and a rudimentary dump of the report to start with here. Ie: Bare bones to get
//       the details out for now, go from there... But there are some things that are already on the radar here:
//
//      1) Format of the human readable report will evolve (wrapping long lines, etc...)
//      2) Other format outputs suitable for automation to process (ie: other automation that will look at the results
//         and do something automatically with it), maybe CSV file, JSON, etc...
//      3) Detail consolidation/redacting suitable for sharing as a Bug report
//      4) Etc...
//

// For example, when we report them we will want to report:
//		1) Per source (cluster, build, etc...)
//		2) Sort in priority order (worst first...) TODO

// Tossing around whether per-source, if we have a map for tracking Issues so we have one Issue per type of issue
// and allow contributing supporting data to it (rather than separate issues for each case found if found in different spots
// I'm hesitant to do that now as that reduces the flexibility, and until we really have the analysis drill-down patterns and
// more scenarios in place I think it is premature to do that (we could maybe allow both, but again not sure we need
// that complexity yet either). One good example is that when there a a bunch of pods impacted by the same root cause
// issue, really don't need to spam with a bunch of the same issue (we could add additional supporting data to one root
// issue instead of having an issue for each occurrence), but the analyzer can manage that and knows more about whether
// it is really a different issue or not.

// We have a map per source. The source is a string here. Generally for clusters it would be something that identifies
// the cluster. But other analyzers may not be looking at a cluster, so they may have some other identification.
// For the current implementation, these are the root file path that the analyzer is looking at.
