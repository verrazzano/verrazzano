// TBD: Overall the intention/design is that we could execute analysis in parallel if we want to do that in the
//
//	future. So in general analyzers are independent of each other and thread safe, and not expecting to
//	be executed in a particular order.
//	However, there may be special cases where we want an analysis to be done and information gleaned
//	from that analysis to be available to other analyzers. For example, the analysis of the state
//	of Verrazzano is something that is likely to fall into that category. It will make a high level
//	determination of where in the lifecycle we are at, and other analyzers may need to easily get that
//	information to give better guidance on the issues/actions.
//
//	The current implementation is calling the analyzers serially in order.
//	If we do decide to handle analysis in a parallel fashion later, we likely will need to have some
//	analyzers called deterministically in exact order before we fire off other analyzers in parallel.
//	So we may break this into 2 lists in the future: serial analysis functions, parallel analysis functions
//	Analyzers that may fall into this category should be annotated, with a comment, there currently is only
//	one that may require that.
