// NOTE: This is part of the contract with the analyzers however it is currently an initial stake in the ground and

//     A Summary of the issue
//     A list of Actions which can be taken
//         - Actions are reported in the order specified in this list (so actions more likely to mitigate an issue
//         should be specified first).
//         - Each action may have Steps to take and/or give a list of runbook Links
//     A list of supporting data (TBD)
//         - Source which helped identify the issue
//         - Indicators that identified the issue (search matches, json elements)
//         - etc...
//     A Confidence level (TBD)
//         This is and indication of how confident the analysis is that the issue is really causing
//         problems. The analysis will attempt to weed out things that are not causing an issue and will
//         not report them if it is certain. However there may be situations where something that is found
//         could be causing problems but it is not certain.
