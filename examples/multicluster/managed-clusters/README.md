# Verrazzano Managed Cluster Install Configurations

These examples show some additional, smaller footprint Verrazzano managed cluster install configurations besides the
recommended `managed-cluster` profile.

The `minimal.yaml` file is provided as an example of the smallest possible managed cluster configuration.

The `minimal-prometheus.yaml` file is provided as an example of a managed cluster configuration that supports metrics
collection from the admin cluster using Prometheus.

The `minimal-thanos.yaml` file is provided as an example of a managed cluster configuration that supports
metrics collection from the admin cluster using Thanos.

For more information on how to use these example files, see [Install Multicluster Verrazzano](https://verrazzano.io/latest/docs/setup/mc-install/multicluster/).
