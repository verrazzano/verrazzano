                                  Hyper-Threading. Intel and AMD processors have two
                                  hardware execution threads per core (OCPU). SMT
                                  permits multiple independent threads of execution,
                                  to better use the resources and increase the efficiency
                                  of the CPU. When multithreading is disabled, only
                                  one thread is permitted to run on each core, which
                                  can provide higher or more predictable performance
                                  for some workloads.

                                          For example, if egress traffic allows TCP

                                          For example, if ingress traffic allows TCP

                                          egress rule to allow TCP source port 80.
