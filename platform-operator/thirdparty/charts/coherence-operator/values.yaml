# imagePullPolicy controls the K8s container spec's pull policy

# The default is "self-signed" where the operator will create self-signed certs for the webhook.
# If set to "cert-manager" it is expected that cert-manager is installed and configured to
# manage the certificates. https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/
# If set to "manual" the certificate Secret should be created and managed externally

# resources will configure the Coherence Operator container's resource limits.
# The resources can be specified in a values file, the same as they would be

#    resources:

#        memory: "64Mi"
#        cpu: "250m"
#      limits:
#        memory: "128Mi"
#        cpu: "500m"
#
# Or, alternatively they can be specified individually using the Helm install --set option, for example
#
# helm install --set resources.requests.memory="64Mi" \
#     -- set resources.requests.cpu="250m"
#     -- set resources.limits.memory="128Mi"
#     -- set resources.limits.cpu="250m"

# clusterRoles controls whether the Helm chart will create RBAC ClusterRole and bindings for the Operator
# These are required if the Operator will watch multiple namespaces.

# If this value is false the Operator will not create CRDs, these MUST be manually installed.
# The default is true.
clusterRoles: true
# nodeRoles controls whether the Helm chart will create RBAC ClusterRole and bindings for the Operator to

# Setting this value clusterRoles and to false will mean that the Operator cannot look up Node labels that will be used
