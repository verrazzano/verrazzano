# serviceAccount specifies the name of the ServiceAccount in the wls's namespace that the
# wls will use to make requests to the Kubernetes API server.
# The customer is responsible for creating the ServiceAccount in the same namespace as this Helm release.
# If not specified, the wls will use the Helm release namespace's 'default' ServiceAccount.
serviceAccount: "default"

# domainNamespaceSelectionStrategy specifies how the wls will select the set of namespaces
# that it will manage. Legal values are: List, LabelSelector, RegExp, and Dedicated. If set to 'List',
# then the wls will manage the set of namespaces listed by the 'domainNamespaces' value.
# If set to 'LabelSelector', then the wls will manage the set of namespaces discovered by a list
# of namespaces using the value specified by 'domainNamespaceLabelSelector' as a label selector.
# If set to 'RegExp', then the wls will manage the set of namespaces discovered by a list
# of namespaces using the value specified by 'domainNamespaceRegExp' as a regular expression matched
# against the namespace names.
# If set to 'Dedicated', then wls will manage WebLogic Domains only in the same namespace
# where the wls itself is deployed, which is the namespace of the Helm release.
domainNamespaceSelectionStrategy: List

# This value is deprecated. Please use 'domainNamespaceSelectionStrategy: Dedicated'.
# dedicated specifies if this wls will manage WebLogic Domains only in the same namespace in

# - "namespace2"
domainNamespaces:
- "default"

# domainNamespaceLabelSelector specifies the label selector value that the wls will use when listing
# namespaces in search of the namespaces that contain WebLogic Domains that this wls will manage. Ignored

# domainNamespaceLabelSelector:

# domainNamespaceRegExp specifies a regular expression that will be matched against namespace names when listing

# featureGates specifies a set of key=value pairs separated by commas that describe whether a given

# feature name and the value is "true". This will allow the wls team to release features that
# are not yet ready to be enabled by default, but that are ready for testing by customers. Once a feature is
# stable then it will be enabled by default and can not be disabled using this configuration.
# featureGates: "...,AuxiliaryImage=true"

# javaLoggingLevel specifies the Java logging level for the wls. This affects the wls pod's

# dns1123Fields overrides the default list of field names that the wls

# introspectorJobNameSuffix overrides the default suffix that the wls uses
# to append to the domainUID to form the name of the domain introspector job name.

# the Kubernetes limit to the name of a job and Kubernetes appends five additional
# characters to the name of the pod that is created by the job controller.
