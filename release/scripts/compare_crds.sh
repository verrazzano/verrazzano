  Shows all CRD differences between two git tags, commits, etc.

  Usage:
    $(basename $0) <release version> <from> <to>

  Example:
    $(basename $0) 1.0.3

  This script should be run from the git repository containing the bits to release. "release version" is required.
  "from" and "to" can be tags, commits, etc. "from" defaults to the most recent version tag for the previous release and "to" defaults to HEAD.
