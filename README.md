# Verrazzano
> **NOTE**: This is an early alpha release of Verrazzano. Some features are still in development.
It is suitable for investigation and educational purposes only; it is not suitable for use in production.

## Introduction
Verrazzano is an end-to-end enterprise container platform for deploying cloud-native and traditional applications in multi-cloud and hybrid environments. It is made up of a curated set of open source components â€“ many that you may already use and trust, and some that were written specifically to pull together all of the pieces to make this a cohesive and easy to use platform.

Verrazzano includes the following capabilities:

- Hybrid and multi-cluster workload management
- Special handling for WebLogic, Coherence, and Helidon applications
- Multi-cluster infrastructure management
- Integrated and pre-wired application monitoring
- Integrated security
- DevOps and GitOps enablement

This repository contains a Kubernetes operator for installing Verrazzano and example applications for use with Verrazzano.

> **NOTE**: This alpha release of Verrazzano is intended for installation in a single OKE or Oracle Linux Cloud Native Environment (OLCNE) cluster. You should install Verrazzano only in a cluster that can be safely deleted when your evaluation is complete.
