## Introduction
Verrazzano is an end-to-end Enterprise Container Platform for deploying cloud-native and traditional applications in multi-cloud and hybrid environments. It is made up of a curated set of open source components â€“ many that you may already use and trust, and some that were written specifically to pull together all of the pieces to make this a cohesive and easy to use platform.

Verrazzano Enterprise Container Platform includes the following capabilities:

- Hybrid and multi-cluster workload management
- Special handling for WebLogic, Coherence, and Helidon applications
- Multi-cluster infrastructure management
- Integrated and pre-wired application monitoring
- Integrated security
- DevOps and GitOps enablement

This repository contains installation scripts and example applications for use with Verrazzano.

> **NOTE**: This is an early alpha release of Verrazzano. Some features are still in development.
